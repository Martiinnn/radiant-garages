# df-garages - 🚗💨 Simple Garage System for PVP/Gang Wars/Academy Servers

Welcome to df-garages, a (very)simple and efficient garage system designed for PVP, Gang Wars, and Academy servers!

🏢 **Polyzone for the Garage Locations**: Enjoy seamless integration with PolyZone, making garage locations a breeze to set up and manage.

👥 **Gang and Owned Vehicles Menu**: This system supports gang vehicles and provides a ox-lib context menu to handle owned vehicles.

💻 **Fast Coding**: I coded this script very fast so it can contains some bugs, let me know i u find one.

⚙️ **Dependencies**:
- [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core): The ESX framework is a requirement for df-garages to work seamlessly.
- [PolyZone](https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone): This project utilizes PolyZone for smooth garage locations setup.
- [OX_LIB](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib): is included as a dependency for the context menu, text ui and notify function.
- [MySQL / OXMYSQL](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql):
- [RODA-GANGS-CREATOR](https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-roda-gangs-esx/4847395): This is my script for gang vehicles. You can easily change the fetch and get gang function to work with your preferred gang script.
